These are simply listed in increasing order of time â€“ not in order of priority or recommendation. Also, the chart is not suggesting that you conduct the activities, like running, swimming or walking, continuously for the time shown.

Keep in mind that one of the basic rules of thumb for healthy weight loss is to lose only 1-2 pounds per week. To lose one pound per week, you will do activities each day that burn an additional 500 calories per day, totaling to 3500 over 7 days. Another approach is to split the calories between exercise and food - eating 250 less and burning 250 more calories each day.

Always check with your physician before starting any new or more strenuous exercise program. </p>";
